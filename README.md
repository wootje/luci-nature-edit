# OpenWrt luci skin - nature edit


Restyled the skin and added a background image.

I use the skin on all my hardware and haven't had any issues. I don't login using my mobile phone, so it's possible that there are some graphical bugs left.

<b>Background:</b>

Copy the files above to "/www/luci-static/bootstrap" and you've installed the skin.
