# OpenWrt luci skin - nature edit


Restyled the skin and added a background image.

I use the skin on all my hardware and haven't had any issues. I don't login using my mobile phone, so it's possible that there are a few small graphical bugs left. 

## Install the skin

1. Copy the files above to the root directory.
   <i>This will put the files automatically in "/www/luci-static/bootstrap".</i> 
2. Activate the "bootstrap" skin in via the web-interface.

you've installed the skin. 

<i>Optionally  replace "background.png" with your own image to change the background if you don't like this one.</i?>
